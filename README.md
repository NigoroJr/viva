# Viva
## Description
Scrape and stream music. It is possible that this gem might break if the
structure of the website changes. I really didn't like their UI, so I wrote
this gem (not so much for practical reasons but because I had fun writing in
Ruby). The website? Go find it in the source code! Why the name Viva? Don't
ask me; ask the [Faker](https://github.com/stympy/faker) gem.

## Installation
You need [mpg123](http://www.mpg123.de/).
